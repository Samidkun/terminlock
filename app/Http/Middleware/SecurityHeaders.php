 * Security response headers.
 *
 * The app shipped without any of these. They are cheap, they apply to every
 * response, and they close the standard browser-side attack classes:
 * clickjacking, MIME sniffing, referrer leakage, and (for the CSP) most
 * injected-script paths.
 *
 * CSP notes: Vite injects inline <script> for the dev server and Inertia
 * embeds the page payload in a data-page attribute, so 'unsafe-inline' is
 * required for scripts in development. In production the built assets are
 * external files, so the inline allowance can be dropped — that is what the
 * environment check below does.
